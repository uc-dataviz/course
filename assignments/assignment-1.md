Part 1: Visualization critique (5 points)
-----------------------------------------

Select a data visualization and write a (roughly) 1000 word critique of the visualization based on the five qualities of great visualizations:[1]

-   Is it truthful?
-   Is it functional?
-   Is it beautiful?
-   Is it insightful?
-   Is it enlightening?

Remember that to critique something does not mean to tear it down or find all the flaws. Critiques should include both positive and negative aspects - what did the author do well? What are the weaknesses of the visualization? How could the truthfulness of the visualization be improved?

Be sure to include a link to the original visualization in your critique. Submit your critique as a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatted document that can be read directly in the repo on GitHub. Write either in the original `.md` file or write it as an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document rendered using the `github_output` format.
