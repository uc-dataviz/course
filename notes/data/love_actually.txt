Love Actually Scripts [ Scene #1 ](Man): 'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world,   I think about the arrival's gate at Heathrow airport.   General opinion started to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed,   but I don't see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere.   Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's always there.   Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.   When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know,   none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge,   they were all messages of love.   If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling, you'll find that love actually is all around.'[ Scene #2 ]Billy: ♪ I feel it in my fingers ♪ I feel it in my toes ♪ Feel it in my toes, yeah ♪   Love is all around me And so the... ♪Joe: I'm afraid you did it again, Bill.Billy: It's just I know the old version so well, you know.Joe: Well, we all do.

They're stuck up, you see. And I am primarily attractive to girls, you know, who are cooler, game for a laugh. Like American girls. So I should just go to America! I'd get a girlfriend there instantly. What do you think?Tony: I think it's crap, Colin.Colin: That's where you're wrong. American girls would dig me with my cute British accent. Tony: You don't have a cute British accent.Colin: Yes, I do! I'm going to America.Tony: Colin, you're a lonely, ugly arsehole.

Total gridlock this morning.[ Scene #14 ]Daniel: Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment. Some of her requests, for instance, that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral, I was confident she expected me to ignore. But others she was pretty damn clear about. When she first mentioned what's about to happen, I said, "Over my dead body." And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine." And as usual, my darling girl... and Sam's darling mum was right. So she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but, inevitably, ever so coolly, through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers. (On speakers): ♪ Bye bye baby, baby goodbye ♪ Goodbye baby, baby bye bye ♪ Bye bye  baby ♪ Don't make me cry ♪ Goodbye baby, baby bye bye ♪ You're the one girl in town I'd marry ♪ Girl I'd marry you now if I were free ♪ I wish it could be ♪ I could  love you but why begin it? ♪ Cos there ain't any future in it ♪ She's got me but I'm not free so... ♪ [ Scene #15 ](From DJ booth): ♪ Bye bye baby, baby goodbye ♪ Goodbye baby, baby bye bye  ♪ Bye bye baby,     don't make me cry ♪ Goodbye baby, baby bye bye ♪ Wish I never had known you... ♪Sarah: Do you love him?Mark: Er, er, what?Sarah: No, l-I just thought I'd ask the blunt question in case it was the right one    and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you   so you never been able to talk about it.  even though you might have wanted toMark:  No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.Sarah: So that's a no, then?Mark: Yes. Erm...This DJ, what do you reckon? The worst in history?Sarah: Probably.

And so does Karl. Think about it, for all our sakes. It's Christmas.Sarah: Certainly. Excellent. Will do. Thanks, boss.Karl: Hi, Sarah.Sarah: Hi, Karl.Kark: Excuse me.Sarah: Babe. Absolutely, fire away. Mia, Mia, would you turn that down? What is that?[ Scene #17 ]DJ:  That was the Christmas effort from the once great Billy Mack.   Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.   I can safely put my hand up my arse and say that is the worst record I've heard this century...   Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be a guest on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes' time.   Welcome back, Bill.Mikey: So Billy, welcome back to the airwaves. New Christmas single, cover of Love Is All Around.Billy: Except we've changed the word "love" to "Christmas".Mikey: Yes, is that an important message to you, Bill?Billy: Not really, Mike. Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.Mikey: And that's not you? Billy: That's not me, Michael. When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish and now    I'm left with no one, wrinkled and alone.Mikey: Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.Billy: For what?Mikey: For actually giving a real answer to a question.   It doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.Billy: Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.Mikey: Best shag you ever had?Billy: Britney Spears.Joe: Wow.Billy: No, only kidding! She was rubbish.Mikey: OK, here's one. How do you think the new record compares to your old, classic stuff?Billy: Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do / the record's crap.(쓰레기)   But wouldn't it be great /if number one this Christmas wasn't some smug(거들먹거리는)  teenager /  but an old ex-heroin addict(중독자)  searching for a comeback at any price? (어떻게든)  Those young popsters come Christmas will be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls   and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager Joe, ugliest man in the world,   fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off.   So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, / like your Uncle Billy does, / buy my festering turd of a record.   And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness(멍청함) of the moment   we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line. Mikey: I think you're referring to "If you really love Christmas..." Billy: " Come on and let it snow." Ouch.Mikey: So, here it is one more time, the dark horse for this year's Christmas number one,   Christmas Is All Around. Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.   Is the new prime minister in trouble already?[ Scene #18 ]PM:  OK. What's next?Alex: The President's visit.PM:  Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play. Alex.Alex: There's a very strong feeling in the party   we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied from pillar to  posts, like the last government.All: Here, here.Jeremy: This is our first really important test, let's take a stand.PM:  Right. Right. I understand that but I have decided... not to.   Not this time. We will, of course, try to be clever…   But, Let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world.   I'm not going to act like a petulant child.   Right -now who do you have to screw around here to get a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit? Right.[ Scene #19 ]PM:  Yup - come in.Natalie: These have just come through from the Treasury...PM:  Uh-huh.Natalie: ..and these are for you.PM:  Excellent. Thanks a lot.Natalie: I was hoping you'd win, not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke too.    Just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.PM:  Ha! Thanks very much. Thanks... Natalie. Oh God, come on, get a grip.   You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.[ Scene #20 ]Jack:  So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?Judy:  Oh, I like him. I can't understand why he's not married, though.Jack:  You know the type, he's married to his job. Either that or gay as a picnic basket.AD:  Excuse me, Judy, if you could just lower the nipples and cheat them a bit to the left?Judy:  OK.Jack:  I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,    it's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.Judy:  Thank you!Jack:  Oh, well, you know.Judy:  And ditto.Jack:  Thank you.AD:   The move again, please, Judy.Judy:  Ooh, sorry.Jack:  Oh, God, sorry. You all right?[ Scene #21 ]Colin:  Exciting news!Tony:  What?Colin:  I've bought a ticket to the States. I'm off in three weeks.Tony:  No.Colin:  Yes! To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.Tony:  No!Colin:  Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!Tony:  No, Col! There ARE a few babes in America, I grant you,    but they're going out with rich, attractive guys.Colin:  Nah, Tone, you're just jealous. You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America    contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me    than the whole of the United Kingdom.Tony:  That is total bollocks. You've actually gone mad.Colin:  No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William without the weird family.Tony:  No, Colin, no!Colin:  Yes!Tony:  Nyet!Colin:  Da!Tony:  Nein!Colin:  Ja, darling![ Scene #22 ]Harry:  Right, the Christmas party, not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise.Mia:  Tell me.Harry:  It's basic, really. Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,    bulk buy the guacamole(아보카도가 든 샐러드)   and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.Mia:  Wives and family and stuff?Harry:  Yes. I mean, not children. But their wives and girlfriends, etc… Oh, Christ,    you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend    you'll be bringing, have you??Mia:  No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe(겨우살이 식물), hoping to be kissed.Harry:  Really? Right.[ Scene #23 ]Daniel:  He now spends all the time in his room. I mean, he'll be up there now.Karen:  There's nothing unusual about that My horrid(징글징글한) son...Daniel:  Bernard?Karen:  Bernard. Stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.Daniel:  No, but Karen, this is all the time. I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?    I mean, clearly it's about his mum, but Christ,    he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know. Karen:  At the age of eleven?Daniel:  Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then. Maybe just his veins. (정맥)   The problem is his mum always used to talk to him, you know, and... I don't know,    this whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter / like it never did before. Karen:  Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time.    Just be patient. And maybe check the room for needles.(주사바늘)Daniel:  And then when he sometimes does come out,    it's obvious he's been crying. It was such a ridiculous waste.    And if it's now going to ruin Sam's life as well... I just don't know.Karen:  Get a grip. People hate sissies.(여자같은 아이)     No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.Daniel:  Yeah. Absolutely. Helpful.[ Scene #24 ]Daniel:  So, what's the problem, Samuel? Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?    Maybe school? Are you being bullied(괴롭힘을 당하다) ? Or is it something worse?    Can you give me any clues at all?Sam:  You really want to know?Daniel:  I really want to know.Sam:  Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?Daniel:  Even if that's the case, yeah.Sam:  OK. Well... truth is, actually... I'm in love. Daniel:  Sorry?Sam:  I know I should be thinking about Mum all the time/  and I am/  but the truth is,/ I'm in love.    I was / before she died/ and there's nothing I can do about it./Daniel:  Aren't you a bit young to be in love?Sam:  No.Daniel:  Ah, well. OK, well... I'm a little relieved.Sam:  Why?Daniel:  Because l... thought it'd be something worse. Sam:  Worse than the total agony of being in love?Daniel:  Er... No, you're right. Total agony.(고통)[ Scene #25 ]Karl:  Night, Sarah.Sarah:  Night, Karl. Yeah, absolutely. Free as a bird. Fire away.[ Scene #26 ]Jamie:  Alone again. Naturally.[ Scene #27 ]man:  I'll deal with it.PM:   Mm. PM:   Ah. Natalie.Natalie: Sir.PM:   Thanks. Natalie. Erm, I'm starting to feel... uncomfortable about us    working in such close proximity every day and me knowing so little about you,    it seems elitist and wrong. Natalie: Well, there's not much to know.PM:   Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?Natalie: Wandsworth. The dodgy end.PM:   Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.Natalie: Oh.PM:   So which exactly is the dodgy end?Natalie: Right at the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.PM:   Right, yes, that is dodgy.Natalie: Hm.PM:   Erm, and you live with your husband? Boyfriend? - Three illegitimate(사생아의) but charming children?Natalie: No. I've just split up with my boyfriend actually, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.PM:   Ah. Sorry.Natalie: No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him. - He said I was getting fat.PM:   I beg your pardon?Natalie: He said no one'd fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks.    Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.PM:   Right... You know, erm... being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered.Natalie: Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.PM:   Do. The SAS are absolutely charming. Ruthless,(무자비한)    trained killers are just a phone call away. Oh, God. Did you have this kind of problem?    Yeah, course you did, you saucy(뻔뻔스런)  minx. (왈가닥, 말괄량이)[ Scene #28 ]Daniel:  So, let's go. We can definitely crack this. Remember, I was a kid once, too.    So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?Sam:  Yeah.Daniel:  Uh-huh. Good, good. And what does she, he, feel about you? Sam:  SHE doesn't even know my name. And even if she did, she'd despise(멸시하다) me.    She's the coolest girl in school. And everyone worships her because she's heaven.Daniel:  Good. Good. Well, basically you're fucked, aren't you?[ Scene #29 ]Ant: Hi there and welcome back. So, three weeks till Christmas,   looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue.Billy: I saw them on the show last week. They weren't very nice about my record.Dec: No. Little scamps. (약간은 망나니들 같다.)Billy: But very, very talented musicians.Ant: Yeah. Billy, I understand you've got a prize for our competition winners.Billy: Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's a personalised felt-tip pen.Dec: Oh, great.Billy: It's brilliant. It even writes on glass, so if you've got a framed picture,   like, for instance, this one of Blue, you can just write on it.Dec: Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.Billy: Oh, yes.Billy: Hiya, kids. Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill - don't buy drugs.    Become a pop star and they give you them for free.Dec: And I do believe it's a commercial break. Thanks goodness.

Although she would have been kind of lonely, I;m sure…PM:  Yes. Pathetic, isn't it? Just never been able to tie a girl down.   I'm not sure politics and dating really go together.US Pr:  Really? I've never found that.PM:  Yes, well, the difference is that you're sickeningly handsome,   whereas I look increasingly like my Aunt Mildred. I'm very jealous of your plane, by the way.US Pr: Thank you. We love that thing. I'll tell you.PM:  Ah, Natalie. Hi.US Pr: Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?US Pr: Excellent.

We cannot and will not consult on that either.Alex: That is unexpected.US Pr: Well, it shouldn't be. The last administration made it perfectly clear.   We are just being consistent with their policies.Alex: But, with all respect, they were bad policies.PM:  Right, Thanks, Alex. I don't think we're making progress here. Let's, erm... move on, shall we?PM:  Well, now, that was an interesting day.US Pr: I'm sorry if our line was firm - there's no point  tiptoeing around today,   and then just disappointing you for four years.  I have plans and I plan to see them through.PM:  Absolutely. There is one final thing I think we should look at - very close to my heart.   If you could just give me a second.US Pr: I'll give you anything you ask for.
